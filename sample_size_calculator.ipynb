The end product is a python function where the user can input the baseline conversion rate, minimum detectable effect, statistical power, and significance level to determine the sample size needed per variation of an experiment."

    "*Note: $\\bar{p}*(1-\\bar{p})$ is used when the variance ($\\sigma^2$) of the within-pair difference is unknown. This equation comes from the Binomial to Normal approximation. \n",
